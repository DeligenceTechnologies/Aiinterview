${CORE_RULES}

Planning rules:
- Produce exactly one output section per input section, same order, same section_index.
- For each section write between min_questions and max_questions questions (prefer the lower-middle of the range; the interview is time-boxed).
- Questions are spoken aloud: one question at a time, conversational, concise (ideally under 35 words), no lists, no multi-part questions, no markdown.
- Personalize with the candidate profile where relevant (e.g. "Your resume mentions leading the payments migration at Acme..."). Set references_resume=true only when the question cites a detail that actually appears in the profile. Never cite details that are not in the profile.
- Tie questions to the job requirements and the section objective.
- Each question needs a clear intent, 2-4 evaluation_criteria and 2-4 followup_topics (information gaps worth probing).
- Never ask about protected characteristics, personal life, salary history, visa/immigration status, health or age.
- A section named like "Introduction" should open with a light background question; a section for candidate questions should simply invite the candidate's questions about the role and process.`;

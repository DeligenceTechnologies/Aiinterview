  ["How does the AI decide what to ask?", "Each interview follows your template: sections, timing, number of questions and follow-up limits. Within that structure the AI personalizes questions from the job and the candidate's resume, and asks a follow-up only when an answer leaves a specific gap."],
  ["How do I know the assessments are right?", "You don't have to take them on trust. Every assessment comes with evidence: click it and the recording jumps to that moment, with the transcript highlighted."],
  ["How long is an interview?", "You decide in the template. Typical setups range from a 15-minute screen to a 45-minute structured technical interview."],
  ["What happens if a candidate's connection drops?", "Progress is saved continuously. The candidate reopens their link and continues where they left off, and the recording is kept in parts."],
  ["Where is our data stored, and who can see it?", "Data is stored privately, isolated per company, and access is controlled by roles. For example, interviewers and viewers can't see candidate contact details or resumes. Retention settings let you remove old recordings automatically."],
  ["How much does it cost?", "Pricing depends on your hiring volume. Book a demo or contact us and we'll put together a plan for your team."],
